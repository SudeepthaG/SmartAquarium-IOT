# Smart Aquarium

Fishes need fresh and clean water to survive and lead healthy lives. Additionally, they also need food to be fed at regular intervals. They also require optimum water levels along with proper temperatures for survival. However, when fishes are placed in large and small aquariums, they often do not meet these required conditions.

To solve the above problems, we have designed an AquiClean module that could perform the following functions:

•	Measures the turbidity of the aquarium water and switch on the water filter when turbidity levels are beyond optimum range.

•	Checks the water temperature and switch on the water heater when the temperature is too low. 

•	Senses the water levels and displays a message when the water levels are too low.

•	Automatically feeds the fishes at regular interval through an automatic feeding system.   

• Allows users to view the stats of the aquarium fom sensors anytime, anywhere through the use of Blynk app.


Thus, by using the AquiClean module the problems which are faced by aquarium users can be solved by automating the process of water cleaning and feeding while maintaining optimum water levels and temperature. This reduces the consumption of human time and efforts required for maintaining an aquarium and making it easier to use in every home.
